# SSH

[SSH](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is a network protocol that lets you make secure remote connections to other servers.

## `config`

You can configure different SSH settings using a `config` file that's usually located in your user's `.ssh` folder. The `.ssh` folder is a hidden folder (because of the `.`) that's located in the top-level of your user folder (your `Home` folder on macOS &#8212; accessed by the alias `~` on the command-line). The `config` file lets you do things like hash hostnames that you've connected to and create entries for quick access to host connections you use frequently. Feel free to use [this `config` file](config) as a reference for some things you might add.
