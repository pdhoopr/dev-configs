# Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is an open-source, cross-platform text editor created by Microsoft. It has some cool features like IntelliSense, Git integration, and more that make it a solid choice for development.

VS Code can be customized and extended in a lot of different ways. The sections below walk you through some of the options you'll find inside the application (opened from the `/Applications` folder or your Dock).

## Preferences

You can configure various preferences by going to `Code` > `Preferences`. You can go through the different sections (some are covered in more detail below) and change things as you see fit.

### Settings

You can configure your settings by going to `Code` > `Preferences` > `Settings`. There are "User Settings" (modifications you'd like to apply across projects) and "Workspace Settings" (modifications using a `.vscode` folder created just for the current project). Feel free to go through and tailor things to your liking! Each setting is pretty well-commented in case you're not sure what it's for. [This `settings.json` file](settings.json) is an example of some modifications to the defaults.

### Color Theme

You can change your editor's syntax theme by going to `Code` > `Preferences` > `Color Theme` and picking the name of the theme you want to use. More color themes can be installed as [extensions](#extensions).

### File Icon Theme

You can add file (and folder) icons to your Side Bar explorer view by going to `Code` > `Preferences` > `File Icon Theme` and picking the name of the theme you want to use. More file icon themes can be installed as [extensions](#extensions).

## Extensions

Extensions can be installed by going to the "Extensions" view in the View Bar on the far left. You can customize the settings for a specific package by reading its documentation to see what settings it exposes, and then making changes to those in to your [settings](#settings). [This `settings.json` file](settings.json) is an example of some modifications to the extension defaults. Some good packages are:
